Assignment 1

Question 1
What is the time, space complexity of following code:
int a = 0, b = 0;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
a = a + 1;
}
for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
b = b + j;
}

Answer 1

The time and space complexity will be O(n) and O(n) respectively.

Question 2
What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y?
a)X will be a better choice for all inputs
b)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly small inputs
c)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly large inputs
d)Y will be a better choice for small inputs

Answer 2
c
